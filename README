Welcome!

This is my attempt to learn clojure while solving the famous 99 problems. I will try to solve the problems described for lisp in this link - http://www.ic.unicamp.br/~meidanis/courses/mc336/2006s2/funcional/L-99_Ninety-Nine_Lisp_Problems.html. I am novice in clojure, so expect to see "whatever works" approach.
